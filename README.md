# Numerical-Methods-for-Engineering-Problems
aimed to apply root-finding techniques to solve engineering challenges. The team, comprising students from diverse departments, defined two engineering problems related to their majors, leading to mathematical equations. Three root-finding methods, including open, closed, or a combination, were selected and compared using MS Excel. The team analyzed convergence speed, initial estimates, and the significance of results in relation to the engineering context. The project involved writing a technical report detailing the problems, methods, results, and their interpretation, along with an Excel file for calculations. The objective was to enhance understanding of numerical methods and their practical applications in engineering.


aimed to explore root-finding techniques and their applications in computer engineering and exponential growth/decay problems. The team defined two engineering problems and applied three numerical methods (bisection, false position, and secant) to solve them. The first problem involved clock distribution networks in computer systems, where parasitic effects influenced the transient response analysis. The second problem modeled exponential growth and decay using an exponential function. MS Excel was used to implement the algorithms and compare the convergence speed, initial estimates, and accuracy of the methods. The project provided insights into the advantages and limitations of each method, contributing to a deeper understanding of numerical methods in engineering contexts.
