# Numerical-Methods-for-Engineering-Problems
aimed to apply root-finding techniques to solve engineering challenges. The team, comprising students from diverse departments, defined two engineering problems related to their majors, leading to mathematical equations. Three root-finding methods, including open, closed, or a combination, were selected and compared using MS Excel. The team analyzed convergence speed, initial estimates, and the significance of results in relation to the engineering context. The project involved writing a technical report detailing the problems, methods, results, and their interpretation, along with an Excel file for calculations. The objective was to enhance understanding of numerical methods and their practical applications in engineering.
